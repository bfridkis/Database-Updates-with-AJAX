# Database-Updates-with-AJAX
This small app demonstrates the use of AJAX requests to modify a database table. Uses Nodejs, Express, and MySql. (Add and delete requests are managed with AJAX requests, while update requests use form submission.)

Hosted with Heroku and its ClearDB add-on. https://database-updates-with-ajax.herokuapp.com/reset-table
